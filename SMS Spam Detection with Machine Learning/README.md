# SMS Spam Detection with Machine Learning

The "SMS Spam Detection with Machine Learning" project is a key component of the Oasis-Infobyte Data Science Internship portfolio. This project employs various machine learning techniques to differentiate between spam (unwanted) and ham (legitimate) SMS messages, aiming to improve the efficiency of spam filtering systems.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to design and implement a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying SMS messages as spam or ham. This involves preprocessing text data, extracting relevant features, and applying classification algorithms to learn from a labeled dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For scripting and model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For processing and analyzing text data.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluating model performance.

## Methodology

The approach to achieving the project objective includes:
1. **Data Collection**: Utilizing a dataset containing labeled SMS messages.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning the text data and converting it to a format suitable for machine learning.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Using techniques like TF-IDF or count vectorization to extract features from text.
4. **Model Training**: Applying classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) to train the model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Key Findings

- Summarize the insights gained during the project, such as the effectiveness of different preprocessing techniques or the performance of various classifiers.
- Highlight the model's accuracy and its ability to generalize to unseen data, discussing any potential improvements or optimizations.
