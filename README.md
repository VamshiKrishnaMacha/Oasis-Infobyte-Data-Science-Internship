## About

This portfolio features a collection of data science projects completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. It encompasses machine learning models, data analysis explorations, and innovative solutions to real-world problems. The projects cover a diverse range of topics and methodologies, showcasing my skills in leveraging data to derive insights and drive decision-making.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Advertising Sales Prediction

- **Objective**: Predict sales revenue based on advertising budgets across multiple media channels.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
- **Description**: This project aims to develop predictive models to forecast sales revenue based on advertising spending across various media channels such as TV, radio, and newspapers. By analyzing historical data and employing machine learning algorithms, the goal is to optimize advertising strategies and maximize sales revenue.

### 2. Car Price Prediction (Used Cars)

- **Objective**: Develop a model to predict the market price of used cars based on their features.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
- **Description**: In this project, I explore a dataset containing information about used cars and their features. By leveraging regression techniques, the objective is to build a model capable of accurately predicting the market price of used cars. This model can assist both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions about car transactions.

### 3. Iris Flower Classification

- **Objective**: Classify iris flowers into one of three species based on measurements of their petals and sepals.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.
- **Description**: This project involves the classic Iris flower dataset, a well-known example in machine learning. By implementing various classification algorithms, the goal is to accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species based on measurements of their petals and sepals. This project serves as an introduction to classification techniques in machine learning.

### 4. SMS Spam Detection with Machine Learning

- **Objective**: Create a spam filter to classify SMS messages as spam or ham.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK.
- **Description**: Spam detection is a crucial task in modern communication systems. In this project, I develop a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (ham). By utilizing natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the aim is to build an effective spam filter to enhance user experience and security.

### 5. Unemployment Analysis Using Python

- **Objective**: Analyze unemployment data to identify trends and insights.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Description**: Unemployment analysis is essential for understanding economic trends and informing policy decisions. This project involves analyzing unemployment data from various sources and conducting comprehensive data analysis and visualization. The objective is to uncover insights into unemployment trends, factors influencing joblessness, and potential policy interventions.
