# Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview

This project explores the classic dataset of Iris flowers, aiming to classify iris plants into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on measurements of sepals and petals. It's a foundational machine learning project that demonstrates the effectiveness of classification algorithms.

## Dataset Description

The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. It includes 150 instances, with 4 attributes each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target species.

- **Data Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
- **Filename**: `Iris (1).csv`

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Installation and Setup

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VamshiKrishnaMacha/Oasis-Infobyte-Data-Science-Internship.git
cd Oasis-Infobyte-Data-Science-Internship/IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Analysis Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to understand the relationships between attributes.
Feature Selection: Choosing relevant features for classification.
Model Building: Training classification models, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
How to Run
Navigate to the project directory and start the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook Iris Flower Classification.ipynb
