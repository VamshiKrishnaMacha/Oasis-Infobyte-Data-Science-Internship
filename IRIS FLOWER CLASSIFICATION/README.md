Oasis-Infobyte Data Science Internship Portfolio
Welcome to the official repository for my Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte! This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio showcasing a series of data science projects that demonstrate my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and the application of innovative solutions to tackle real-world problems across various domains.

Projects Overview
Throughout my internship, I've worked on several projects, each focused on different aspects of data science and machine learning. Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this portfolio:

1. Advertising Sales Prediction
Objective: Predict sales revenue based on advertising budgets across multiple media channels.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
Resources Provided: Jupyter Notebook for analysis, dataset (CSV).
2. Car Price Prediction (Used Cars)
Objective: Develop a model to predict the market price of used cars based on their features.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
Resources Provided: Jupyter Notebook for analysis, dataset (CSV).
3. Iris Flower Classification
Objective: Classify iris flowers into one of three species based on measurements of their petals and sepals.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.
Resources Provided: Jupyter Notebook for analysis, dataset (CSV).
4. SMS Spam Detection with Machine Learning
Objective: Create a spam filter to classify SMS messages as spam or ham.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK.
Resources Provided: Jupyter Notebook for analysis, dataset (CSV).
5. Unemployment Analysis Using Python
Objective: Analyze unemployment data to identify trends and insights.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Resources Provided: Jupyter Notebook for analysis, dataset (CSV).
Installation
To get started with these projects, you'll need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/VamshiKrishnaMacha/Oasis-Infobyte-Data-Science-Internship.git
cd Oasis-Infobyte-Data-Science-Internship
Each project folder contains all necessary resources, including datasets (in CSV format) and Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) with complete code for analysis. Please refer to individual project folders for specific installation instructions and requirements.

Usage
Each project is contained within its own directory, complete with Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) that can be viewed and run using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. To launch Jupyter:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Navigate to the project directory of your choice and open the notebook file to explore the project.

Contributing
I'm always looking to improve the projects in this repository. If you have suggestions, feedback, or want to contribute, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
