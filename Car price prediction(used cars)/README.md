# Car Price Prediction (Used Cars)

This project is a part of the Oasis-Infobyte Data Science Internship portfolio, focusing on the development of a predictive model for used car prices. By analyzing historical data, the model aims to predict the market price of a used car based on its features such as make, model, mileage, age, and condition.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to utilize machine learning techniques to accurately predict the prices of used cars. This involves understanding the factors that significantly affect the pricing of cars in the secondary market and building a model that can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for analysis and model building.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Methodology

The project follows these steps to achieve the objective:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a comprehensive dataset of used car listings.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to identify patterns and insights.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that can enhance model performance.
5. **Model Training and Selection**: Training multiple models and selecting the best performer based on evaluation metrics.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the final model's performance on unseen data.

## Key Findings

- Include a summary of key insights discovered during the EDA and model development process. For example, the impact of vehicle age and mileage on its price.
- Discuss the performance of the final model, including metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) or R-squared values.
