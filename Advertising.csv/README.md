# Sales Prediction Using Python

As an integral component of the Oasis-Infobyte Data Science Internship portfolio, the "Sales Prediction Using Python" project demonstrates the application of data science in addressing real-world challenges. This endeavor highlights the predictive power of machine learning to forecast sales outcomes based on advertising investments across various media channels.

## Objective

The aim is to leverage linear regression to predict sales revenue, unraveling how advertising expenditures in TV, radio, and newspapers influence sales performance. This project offers a deep dive into the quantifiable impact of different advertising channels on sales.

## Technologies and Libraries

Implemented in Python, this project employs several key libraries:
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For insightful data visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.

## Methodology

The approach encompasses several critical stages:
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Ensuring the dataset is primed for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual exploration of data to identify patterns.
3. **Model Building**: Crafting a linear regression model to forecast sales.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Determining the model's accuracy using evaluation metrics.

## Key Findings

- TV advertising emerges as the most influential medium on sales.
- The constructed linear regression model proves to be highly effective in predicting sales from advertising spends.
