### Sales Prediction Using Python

#### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict product sales using advertising budget data. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to build a regression model that can estimate future sales based on expenditures across various advertising media such as TV, radio, and newspapers.

#### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for analysis and model building.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.

#### Methodology
The project follows a systematic approach to achieve the sales prediction objective:
1. **Data Loading**: We start by loading the sales and advertising data from a CSV file.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: The data is then cleaned and prepared, making it suitable for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This step involves analyzing the data to understand patterns, relationships, and underlying trends.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Before model training, the data undergoes preprocessing to enhance model performance.
5. **Model Training**: A linear regression model is trained using the prepared dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated to ensure accuracy and reliability.
7. **Prediction and Conclusion**: Finally, the model is used for prediction, and conclusions are drawn based on the model's performance.

#### Key Findings
- The linear regression model showed a strong capability in predicting sales based on advertising budgets.
- Analysis revealed that TV advertising had the most significant impact on sales, followed by radio and newspapers.
- The model's performance evaluation indicated a high level of accuracy, making it a reliable tool for forecasting sales based on advertising spend.
